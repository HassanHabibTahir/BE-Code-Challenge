## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹


Thanks for your interest in joining the Thrive Dev team. In order for us to better evaluate your experience, skills, and fit for our team, we'd like you complete a small coding challenge.



**The challenge**

Create a blogging platform API capable of managing blog posts, blog authors, and blog comments. Handling user authorization is not a requirement, but a plus. No front-end is required.



You must use:

* node.js

* Typescript,

* a graphQL server,

* an RDBM system (mysql, postgreSQL, or MSSQL are all ok)

* The rest of your implementation is down to you (libraries, frameworks, etc)



For your code submission, it's preferred that you send us a link to a GIT repository showing your personal commits, rather than a zip file, but a ZIP is acceptable. Your submission should include:



the code

a complete README on how to run the code, including any environment variables

the SQL schema for your database
