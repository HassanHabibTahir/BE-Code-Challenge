## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for your interest in joining the Thrive Dev team. In order for us to better evaluate your experience, skills, and fit for our team, we'd like you complete a small coding challenge.

## The challenge

You are building out a payment API for an e-commerce platform. You're working on the user story "As a user, I can submit my order and payment details to the system, in order to complete my purchase".

## The acceptance criteria are:

Functional requirements

- Provide the order items including itemId, quantity

- Provide payment details: cardNo, expiryDate, CVC no

- Non-functional requirements

- API request must be validated (_no need to validate payment details for this challenge!_)

- ItemIds exist

- Items are in stock

- Calls to API must be idempotent

You _must_ use:

- Typescript in node.js OR a statically-typed language

- REST or graphQL as the API layer

- a persistence layer

- The rest of your implementation is down to you (libraries, frameworks, etc)-

**For your code submission, it's preferred that you send us a link to a GIT repository showing your personal commits, rather than a zip file, but a ZIP is acceptable. Your submission should include:**

- the code

- a complete README on how to run the code, including any environment variables

- if you use an RDBM persistence layer , provide the SQL schema as a SQL file

Thank you! Happy coding :)
